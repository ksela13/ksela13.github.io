# Team 208 Charter: 


## Charter

Based on the goals listed above and through a team discussion, we constructed the following charter:

_To be successful in our understanding of microcontroller programming while addressing how environmental sensing influences can affect real world applications in our final project._


## Product Mission Statement

Based on the project description and project requirements, Team 208 has come up with the following mission statement:

_Our team will create an embedded systems device that senses at least two environmental conditions. This device will have at least one controlled response that reacts based on the sensory data. All sensing and actuation will be accomplished using serial communication. Our device will be used to solve a real world problem and will be demonstrated at the Polytechnic innovation showcase to industry professionals. The team will stay within budget and within the requirements of the 314 course. Some, but not all, of these requirements are surface mount components only, using cadence only, and board communication over wifi._


# <span style="text-decoration:underline;">User Needs: </span>

**Our Process: **To complete user needs analysis, the team met online via Discord. This made sharing screens and files easy. Then we decided that Jamboard would be used to display and consolidate our ideas. Then each team member started to add user needs ideas to the board. No idea was rejected at first, all team members suggested and wrote whatever need they could think of. No team member rejected ideas at this point, this was merely to get a large pool of user needs on the table. Then we organized all the user needs into groups. This helped to reduce the number of repeat user needs in each category. Next, we ranked each section by how much the team valued them. Finally, we ranked every need in each category as well. This gave us a very good idea of what we value and absolutely need in the design.  Based on the reviews the team saw on Amazon and other websites we then compiled and created a list of needs to suit the requirements of our product requirement


## Benchmarking:

**Our Process: **The team met on Discord again to do the benchmarking. First we agreed that we would look up ideas relating to Parkinson’s or nerve damage therapy relating to the hand. This produced a few different products that the team thought were interesting and helpful. We analyzed the positive and negative comments on each product to get more needs/ wants/ and pain points directly from users. The team’s plan was to review these products and find ways to incorporate the best parts of them into our own design and eliminate any potential pain points.

# Product Requirements

**Our Process:** The team decided that each major category of the product requirements will  be the major categories that our user needs are organized into. These groups are not the suggested groups, but we felt like these will better inform our design based on our user needs. This will make it easier to both rank and generate the product requirements as we come up with and design our concepts. The product requirement list below is organized from the most important major category at the top and least at the bottom. Within each category the top most product requirement is the most important of that category.

**Stakeholders:**

Target Users: People with nerve damage or limited mobility in the hand.

# Design Ideation

**Idea Generation Process:** For Team 208’s Design Ideation, we chose to look at what characteristics made our benchmarked examples successful products and how they could be improved upon. Listed below are one hundred ideas that discuss various aspects of potential design movements, material considerations, electrical component ideas, and other other potential successful characteristics. Once we had generated one hundred ideas, they were separated then into color coordinated categories and grouped  based on their ability to meet our project requirements.

## Design Concepts:

**Balloon Grip Sensor Therapeutic Glove:**



<p id="gdcalert6" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image6.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert7">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image6.png "image_tooltip")


**Description:** This concept will be tethered to a wall power supply to avoid the need for a battery. The wall power supply will then go to a control box that houses our PCB. This will protect the PCB and make the glove design more streamlined. This box will have LED indicators to display how hard someone is gripping. The glove will have a balloon with a pressure sensor inside it to measure the grip strength of someones hand. The motor on the back of the hand will increase tension in the glove if a person is gripping too hard, and release if they decrease grip strength. This design will meet all class requirements. This design will also feature a temperature sensor that can indicate if someone is gripping something too hot.

**Variable Force Sensing Temperature/Pressure Glove**

![alt_text](images/image7.png "image_tooltip")


**Description: **This design will be battery powered for extra mobility. It will be fully enclosed in the glove and will not have any external parts. A compression sleeve on each finger will be the actuator. These will relax the fingers when someone is gripping too hard. LED indicators on the side of the glove will indicate grip strength. There will also be a LED screen for easy viewing of data. This design meets all class requirements.

**Velcro on Fingers for Various Sizes**

![alt_text](images/image8.jpg "image_tooltip")



# Selected Design

**Design Description:** The selected design is based mostly on the balloon grip sensor, with aspects from the other two designs. This new design will have two force sensors on the end of the index finger and the inside of the thumb. These sensors will be in place of the balloon pressure sensor. The team decided that the balloon would be too complex to manufacture and calibrate. The temperature sensor will be on the palm of the glove, this will sense if something is too hot to be touching. A motor on top of the wrist will pull on resistive bands attached to each finger when a person is exceeding a certain grip strength. Data from the sensors will be communicated wirelessly. The PCB itself will not be attached to the glove and instead be housed in a protective case external to the glove. This external control box will have three LEDs on it to indicate user grip strength. The design will be powered by a wall power supply and is not designed to be worn casually. Instead this device will be designed to be used in physical therapy settings with people that have little to no feeling in their hands, due to nerve damage.

**Glove Description:** The glove will feature force sensors on the index finger and the thumb, a temperature sensor on the inside of the palm, and a motor on the back of the hand. The motor will pull at the resistive bands on each finger. A cable will run from the glove to the control box that will provide power, ground, and signal transmission.

**Description:** To deliver power to our nerve damage pressure glove we will be using a wall outlet 


    that supplies 5V and 1A to power up the device and let it function. Power will pass into a voltage regulator where it will output at 3.3V and proceed to the microcontroller. The microcontroller will be connected to and receive data from all of our sensors. When a user holds on to something with the glove the thin film pressure sensors will relay that information back to the microcontroller via ADC which converts it into an SPI signal. Our ESP32 wifi module utilizes UART and can upload the information to the server at a medical facility or someone's phone.

**Description:** The bill of materials contains all the parts each section of the nerve damage therapy glove will be utilizing. All parts meet the requirements and unless specified otherwise are surface mounted.  Everything from the voltage regulators to the OP-AMP and even our resistors and capacitors are surface-mounted. The only parts that aren’t surface mounted are the barrel jack, motor, microcontroller, and wall plug to supply power to the device.  A variety of communication methods are utilized such as SPI, UART, and I2C.  Our wall power supply supplies voltage at a measurement of 5V and 1A to a switching voltage regulator. From the switching voltage regulator the power drops down and comes out to 3.3 V. Our force sensors are resistive which utilize an ADC device to convert their analog signals to SPI so it can be read by the microcontroller. The ESP32 utilizes UART to communicate all this data over wifi to a digital storage space such as someone’s personal device or the medical records system at a doctor’s office.

**Final Microcontroller Choice**: PIC16F18875-I/P

**Rationale**: Team 208 decided to move forward with PIC16F18875-I/P because of the three microcontrollers it had the most user and application notes. It also meets all of the project's requirements at the lowest overhead and doesn’t require separate hardware to work. This part also comes in a through hole and surface mount option for project implementation.

**Description:  **For this project we decided to break up our software proposal into multiple different sections as we believed it would be easier for readers of this report to understand. Each section shows how that part will operate and what it does as well. We have the main loop showing how the overall process will happen along with the chain showing how the wifi will communicate with UART and the ESP32 device.  The LED loop shows how many LEDs will turn on depending on how much force is applied to an object by a user when they are wearing the glove. Depending on how much force is applied either the green or the red LED will then turn on. The team used only one interrupt to run the update motor function every second.

**Description:** The team schematic has been broken into sections to reduce confusion. There are six major sections in the team system. These are the switching voltage regulator, temperature sensor, LED array, motor driver, force sensors, and the microcontroller. Each section has arrows on the end of wires that connect to other sections. These arrows indicate the exact pin that wire should connect to.

# Appendix A: Team 208’s Charter


# Team 208’s Charter

_Goals: _



* 
Create a project that is able to capture our audience’s attention during the Innovation Showcase.


* 
Developing a great addition to our engineering portfolios.


* 
Getting experience using industry level tools to create our project.


*

Increase our knowledge of microcontrollers and interconnecting subsystems.


* 
Increase your proficiency in the use of the software and gain a clear understanding of how each module in MPLAB works and how it works.


* 
Improve team organization and coordination skills and clarify integrated common goals.
**Charter**

Based on the goals listed above and through a team discussion, we constructed the following charter:

_To be successful in our understanding of microcontroller programming while addressing how environmental sensing influences can affect real world applications in our final project._

**Product Mission Statement**

Based on the project description and project requirements, Team 208 has come up with the following mission statement:

_Our team will create an embedded systems device that senses at least two environmental conditions. This device will have at least one controlled response that reacts based on the sensory data. All sensing and actuation will be accomplished using serial communication. Our device will be used to solve a real world problem and will be demonstrated at the Polytechnic innovation showcase to industry professionals. The team will stay within budget and within the requirements of the 314 course. Some, but not all, of these requirements are surface mount components only, using cadence only, and board communication over wifi._

**Communication Procedures**

_Team Communication:_

All team members will conduct communication to one another through text or Discord, in class collaboration and possibly through Zoom as seen in **Table 1**. Other alternative modes of communication include phone calls and emails. These will be used when necessary and will not be primary methods of communication. 

_Instructor Correspondence:_

Felicia Szleszinski will be responsible for instructor correspondence and will communicate all information to the team via text.

**Meeting Schedule**

**_Table 2: Team Member Availability Schedule_**

![alt_text](images/image15.png "image_tooltip")


_Team Prefered Meeting Times:_

For our team, meeting on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday between 5:00 pm and 9:00 pm will be most effective based on the data collected in **Table 2.**

**Meeting Coordination**

_Team Preferred Meeting Reminder Format:_

To help maintain scheduled team meetings our team will utilize a shared calendar.

_Team Preferred Meeting Alterations:_

If a team member needs to alter the time of a scheduled meeting or add an additional meeting time, they will reach out to the other team members via text or verbally. Once all team members have confirmed the change it will be reflected in the shared calendar.

_Team Preferred Meeting Format:_

Meeting face to face will be the most effective way for our team to communicate, followed by the voice channel in discord as our primary second choice. If those options are not available, meeting virtually is also applicable. 

_Team Other Necessary Procedures:_

Phone call communication is our alternative means of contact to notify of emergencies or last minute additional meetings. This resource will only be utilized if the primary communication sources were unsuccessful.

**Team Coordination**

_Team Preferred Assignment Sign Off and Submission:_

The team member submitting the assignment will always check with all the other team members that the assignment is ready to submit before submitting. This will happen via one of our primary communication methods. If a team member does not respond to this, secondary methods of communication will be used. If there is no response from either of these, the team member submitting will be allowed to submit without the unresponsive team member’s approval.

_Individual Team Member Comprehension and Adjustment:_

Team members should always inform the team if they don’t have the knowledge or skills to perform the work assigned. The team will come together and help each other to complete this work. Hopefully this will help the team learn together rather than struggle separately.

_Team Feedback Coordination:_

Feedback from assignments will be discussed by the team together. This will help us understand both the good and the bad parts of the assignment. The editing of documents according to feedback can be done individually if the team decides to divide and conquer. But the most important part is that we talk through it briefly to know what to do on future assignments.

**Team Accountability**

 

_Accountability Expectations:_

All team members should be contributing equally. Of course, with different expertises in different areas, varying amounts of work will be performed per each team member. This is not a problem as long as everyone is committed to working together and diligently.

_Recognizing Underperforming Team members:_

If a team member feels that themselves or another team member is underperforming it should be brought to the attention of the entire team. Signs of this include not attending meetings, classes, not helping each other, or not doing the work assigned.

_Supporting Team Members: _

Each team member is responsible for making sure their own and each other’s workloads are balanced. Helping each other and working together are the best ways to succeed in the course. Because of this, team members should not be afraid to ask for help when needed.

_Accountability Consequences:_

A discussion about why and how the underperformance is happening will happen. Hopefully a solution is found and the team member gets the help he/she needs. If it is not resolved, the professor will be contacted and informed on the situation.

**Conflict and Resolution**

Controversy or difference in opinions is expected in any group setting, however we all have the shared goal of learning and should always be respectful to one another. For our group, I don’t believe this will be an issue, however if any issues arise then we will host a group meeting with all team members to come up with a compromise or resolution for the conflict.

# Appendix B: User Needs and Benchmarking


# **Team 208 User Needs and Benchmarking**

**Our Process:**

To complete user needs analysis, the team met online via Discord. This made sharing screens and files easy. Then we decided that Jamboard would be used to display and consolidate our ideas. Then each team member started to add user needs ideas to the board. No idea was rejected at first, all team members suggested and wrote whatever need they could think of. No team member rejected ideas at this point, this was merely to get a large pool of user needs on the table. Then we organized all the user needs into groups. This helped to reduce the number of repeat user needs in each category. Next, we ranked each section by how much the team valued them. Finally, we ranked every need in each category as well.

**Benchmarking **

**Our Process:**

The team met on Discord again to do the benchmarking. First we agreed that we would look up ideas relating to Parkinson’s or nerve damage therapy relating to the hand. This produced a few different products that the team thought were interesting and helpful. We analyzed the positive and negative comments on each product to get more user needs directly from users.

   <td>“So my Mom has had weakness in her left side for a while. She didn't think this glove was really going to do anything she hadn't already been doing. We started out on the auto exercise for 5 minutes a day on her left hand. It's hard for her to get her left hand to do anything, it doesn't mind and kind of gets grabby on its own.
<p>
After a few days of using this device, Mom found herself reaching for an object with her left hand, just using the power of her mind - you know, like your body should! Every movement she has to do needs to be so mindful, so her brain thinking "I want that object" and sending her left hand, which was closest, to get it is an absolute breakthrough!
<p>
The glove works through air pressure to make your hand open and close. It doesn't feel weird when it does it, and she really likes that it makes her fingers extend, since that's also an exercise she doesn't do often anymore. You can adjust the intensity, the pressure, and even use the other glove on your right hand to send messages to the left on what you would like it to do.
<p>
Obviously, your mileage may vary. Everyone works at their own pace and can only do what they can, but I see how this device can help people relearn to use their hand. She'll never be 100%, but every little bit counts.”

The device uses a comfortable amount of pressure to provoke exercise. (explicit)

<li>The glove forces the user to extend and retract fingers to promote movement in limbs. (explicit)

   <td>“What I love about this robot glove is how straight forward it is to use. The different modes and intensity level can easily be changed via the control monitor (orange box). Air pressure can be turned off to a particular finger by the white valves on the glove which makes it easy to isolate a particular finger or fingers for training. What I really love the most is the mirror training glove, genius. The mirror glove is worn on the non-training hand. When I clench the mirror glove and press a button it mimics this movement on the robot glove. This is great for trying to retrain your hand and stimulate movement. The glove works by air compression and is a bit on the loud side when the orange box is pumping air. The control box is cordless so can be taken anywhere without having to rely on an outlet. I appreciate the fact that they actually included a AC USB charger and cable.”
